Developed a Keras-based deep-learning pipeline to classify Amazon product reviews into 1–5 star ratings. I balanced and sampled the data, cleaned and tokenized text, and padded sequences for a fixed input length. I then built and tuned neural networks—experimenting with embedding layers, pooling, dense architectures, dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping—to maximize validation accuracy and guard against overfitting.

Key Achievements

Data Engineering: Sampled 1,000 reviews per rating, cleaned text (lowercasing, punctuation removal), tokenized and padded to 200-token sequences.

Model Design & Tuning: Architected feed-forward networks with embedding+pooling, iteratively optimized via dropout rates, weight penalties, and early stopping.

Results & Insights: Established a solid baseline, diagnosed misclassifications (mixed‐sentiment reviews), and outlined next steps—scaling data, exploring LSTM/Transformer models, and richer feature engineering.
